## Overview of Project
Our friend Louise wants to see how different Kickstarter campaigns fared based on the dates of launch and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Analysis to provide insight on different Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- The month of May had the highest number of successful campaigns launched at over 1.5 times the amount of any other month.
	- The month of December had the least amount of successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- 100% of campaigns with funding goals between $45,000 and $49,999 failed while campaigns with funding goals of less than $1,000 were successful 76% of the time. In general, as the funding goals increase, the chance of them being met decreases. Although there is a spike up to 67% for campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $44,999. This tells us that there must be some reason besides higher funding goals that campaigns fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- This dataset is limited by the fact that we have no demographic data on the patrons of these campaigns. The annual income, or the general interests of the population might give us some insight into why some campaigns do better than others. It might also give us some idea as to why there was a spike in successful campaigns around the $35,000 range, or why campaigns seem to do much better when launched in the month of May. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- It might be useful to make another graph comparing the outcomes of campaigns from different categories against the outcomes from theater and plays. Maybe there is some unifying trend that is less of a mystery in another category that will let us understand our category of interest a little better.
